🗽 NYC Taxi Trips Analysis with Apache Spark
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes NYC Yellow Taxi trip records using Apache Spark.
The goal is to practice big data processing, Spark SQL, and Spark MLlib by:

- Cleaning and preparing raw taxi trip data.
- Running analytical queries to uncover insights.
- Building a machine learning model to predict trip duration.

⚙️ Tech Stack

- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks / VSCode
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly

🔍 Features Implemented

✅ Data cleaning (filter invalid fares & trips)
✅ Spark SQL queries for trend analysis
✅ Aggregations: busiest pickup zones, average fares, trip distances
✅ MLlib regression model for trip duration prediction
✅ Visualizations of results

📈 Results

- Top 10 pickup zones
- Monthly revenue trends
- Dashboard for interactive visualizations.
- Model for trip duration prediction

📌 Next Steps

- Add real-time streaming with Spark Structured Streaming (simulating live trips).
- Deploy with Docker for reproducibility.
